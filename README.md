# AI Chamber
Better AI Dungeon

## what
AI Dungeon used to be good but now it's pay-to-win, privacy invasive, etc.
So I decided to remake it but without the bad parts

## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. Set up a python virtual environment e.g. `python3 -m venv venv` and activate
3. Install requirements e.g. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the game e.g. `python3 singleplayer.py`

## Why is it so bad
The AI model which AI Dungeon uses is specially trained for generating text
adventures, whereas this model isn't because I don't have enough computing
power to make one.

You can, however, improve the quality of the output by using a well-written
prompt. An easy way to get one of these is by copying it from AI Dungeon.
